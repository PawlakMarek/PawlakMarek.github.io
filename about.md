Hi,
I'm Marek and I'm a typical geek.

I'm IT Support Engineer interested in new technology, comic books (especially Marvel's), food and travel.
Surely you'll find that my posts revolve around these topics, but sometimes they may go astray ;) therefore bare in mind that all of them are my personal and subjective opinions and should not be linked with any organization I may be affiliated.
