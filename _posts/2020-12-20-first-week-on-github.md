OK, so let's get it started (again)!

I'm gonna start my new journey with web dev at github training lab [***First Week on GitHub***](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github) and track all the progress at this blog.

So far finished the github pages with jekyll training, which results you can see here :)

I'm not gonna have much time for the courses and frequent publications, but I'll do my best.
There's still some time which I can use today, so I'm gonna complete as many trainings as possible and update this post with the progress at the end of day.
