I just finished my [***First Week on GitHub***](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github) in just 2 days :D

Well, maybe not yet finished, as I stuck on the last training [Securing your workflows](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/securing-your-workflows) due to some issue with dependency *visionmedia/debug* not being recognized as vulnerable. I've reported it and try to finish it when it'll be fixed.

Whole training path have been a good refresher about using git (commits, branches, merging, pull requests) and a quick glance how it's been implemented in the GitHub. It may be a really good tool for people not accustomed with the CLI or these who just prefer work with GUI.

What's more, it's familiarizing you with a great and simple tool for hosting static pages which is GitHub Pages.

I think I'll stay some indefinitely time with it and update you with any new functionality I'll get familiar with :)

As next steps in my new WebDev path I'm gonna go through Microsoft's [Web Development for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners), which seems to be a good starting point.

Of course all my progress will be published here on at least weekly basis.
