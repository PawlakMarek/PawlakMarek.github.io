I'm quite accustomed with programming in general, because I've been already creating simple websites when XHTML has been just released (OhMiGosh, it's been already over 20 years!), also been programming for many years in C/C++ as a hobby.

Currently I'm using python in my everyday work and most of my work consist of CLI tasks in unix environments.

Due to mentioned reasons I've allowed myself to just skip through first 2 lessons, because first one is quite obvious to me and second I just finished by completing the First Week on GitHub lab.

The 3rd one has been pretty interesting. It's good to see that there's such a big focus on accessibility and so many tools and technics have been created to make it easier for people with disabilities, then it's even bigger a shame that so many sites neglect it in their own design.

Let's finally head to something more practical with JS basics.
